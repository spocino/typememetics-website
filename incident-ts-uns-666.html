<b><u>Description:</u></b>
<p>
TS-UNS-666 is a psychological breakdown event triggered by prolonged exposure to colleagues' systematic misuse of unsigned integer types in high-stakes financial systems. The affected operative, working on systems where errors result in "millions of dollars of users' funds" being lost, developed what he describes as "PTSD from unsigned ints." The condition manifested as an obsessive, paranoid fixation on the mathematical and logical inconsistencies introduced by unsigned integer arithmetic, particularly in mixed signed/unsigned operations.
</p>
<p>
The operative's descent began with legitimate technical concerns: the dangers of implicit conversions, the complexity of bounds checking, and the fundamental mismatch between unsigned arithmetic and real-world APIs. However, his rational critique devolved into existential horror as he witnessed colleagues repeatedly introducing the very vulnerabilities he warned against. The breaking point occurred when he realized that `- x` and `0u - x` produce "two completely different things" in C. A revelation that shattered his faith in the logical consistency of the universe itself.
</p>

<b><u>Special Containment Procedures:</u></b>
<p>
The operative has been removed from all financial systems and placed in Cognitive Isolation Ward, where he is permitted to work only with provably pure, mathematically consistent type systems. All unsigned integer types have been banned from his environment. He is to be monitored for signs of further decompensation, particularly any attempts to "purify" his colleagues' codebases through unauthorized modifications.
</p>
<p>
<font color="red"><b>WARNING:</b></font> The operative has begun exhibiting signs of religious delusion, claiming that unsigned integers are "an affront to divine mathematical order" and that his colleagues deserve "divine retribution" for their "heretical type choices." He has been observed muttering prayers in lambda calculus and constructing shrine-like arrangements of Haskell textbooks. Do not engage him in discussions about integer overflow or modular arithmetic.
</p>
<hr>

<b><u>Addendum TS-UNS-666-A (26-AUG-2025):</u></b>
<p>
The operative's condition has deteriorated further. From his containment cell, he has begun issuing "linguistic purity directives" to Institute staff, claiming that the term "unsigned integer" has become "a slur against the divine order of natural numbers." He insists that all personnel refer to these data types exclusively as "the ℕ-word" (referencing the mathematical symbol for natural numbers).
</p>
<p>
When reminded that unsigned integers can represent zero and are therefore not strictly natural numbers, the operative became catatonic for six hours, muttering only "zero is the absence of God" repeatedly. His theological framework appears to be collapsing under the weight of its own mathematical inconsistencies.

<b><u>Incident Log: 25-AUG-2025</u></b>
<pre>
<b>08:41:00</b> - Operative [REDACTED] submits a 255-page technical memo titled
         "Unsigned: A Mathematical and Moral Critique." Initial
         assessment deems it "thorough but unnecessarily emotional."
<b>10:22:00</b> - Operative is found in the break room, staring at a whiteboard
         covered in equations demonstrating unsigned integer edge cases.
<b>14:03:00</b> - During a code review, the operative becomes agitated when a
         colleague suggests using `size_t` for array indexing. He begins
         shouting about "the false promise of non-negativity" and "the
         betrayal of mathematical truth."
<b>16:47:00</b> - Security is called when the operative is discovered attempting
         to "exorcise" unsigned integers from the codebase by manually
         replacing every `unsigned` with `int` and adding bounds checks.
<b>18:39:00</b> - In his final coherent statement before containment, the
         operative declares: "I have seen the face of chaos, and it is
         `0u - 1`. My colleagues have chosen the path of damnation. Only
         divine retribution can cleanse this corruption. The Lord of Types
         will judge them for their sins against mathematical purity."
<b>19:02:00</b> - Operative is sedated and transferred to the Ward. His
         workstation is found covered in printouts of Haskell's `Natural`
         type documentation, arranged in a totem.
